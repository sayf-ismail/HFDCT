## Hyperledger Fabric Developer Certification Training - Sayf Ismail

### Instructions
Please run the file with the node.js commands 
eg
`node section1_question1`

### Section 1 - `>>node section1_question1`
Sum of the digits in 100! is 60

### Section 2
#### Question 1 - `>>node section2_question1`

Here I have chosen to store the instances in a javascript Map because:
1) The keys can be any primitive type. In this case the Key is the id of the account, which is an integer.
2) Elements in this data structure can be ordered.
3) Flexibility as there are default methods like `has()`, `values()`, `delete()`
4) Highly efficient for search and moderately efficient for insertion
5) Records are accessible by unique account number (sometimes called an exact-match query).

#### Question 2 - `>>node section2_question2`

Here I created instances of DevAccounts, which are capable of transferring to each other.
